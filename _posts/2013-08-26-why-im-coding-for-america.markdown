I spent the summer of 2013 interning at [Code for America][Code for America]. Here, I had the chance to watch a great community of civic-tech professionals make positive impact. Code for America is a cross-pollination of government and innovational tech industries. 

At the beginning of summer, I wrote a guest blog post: [Why I'm Coding for America][Why I'm Coding for America]. There, you can read about the greatly fulfilling experience I had at CfA.
